<p align="center">Un shell minimaliste</p>

## Why:

Minishell is a school team-working project aiming to recreate our own bash.


## How To Use:

Use 'make' then execute './minishell' to start the program. You may use different commands to test the project (see examples below). 


## Examples:

Commands like 'cat', 'ls', 'grep', 'wc', etc. can be used to test the project.<br>
Single quotes and double quotes works the same as bash.<br>
Redirections ('<', '>', '<<', '>>') and pipes ('|') work as well.<br>
Built-ins were also made from scratch (cd, echo, env, export, exit, pwd, unset).<br>
Ctrl+C, Ctrl+D and Ctrl+\ are implemented the same way as bash.<br>
