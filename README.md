<p align="center">A Minimalist Shell</p>

Minishell is a lightweight, custom-built Unix shell implemented in C. It provides a minimalistic, user-friendly command-line interface, allowing users to execute common shell commands and navigate the file system. By implementing core shell functionalities from scratch, Minishell offers a unique opportunity to gain in-depth understanding of shell programming and Unix system calls. Perfect for educational purposes or as a foundation for more advanced shell projects, Minishell showcases the power of simplicity in a user-friendly package.


## Why:

Minishell is a school team-working project aiming to recreate our own bash.


## How To Use:

Use 'make' then execute './minishell' to start the program. You may use different commands to test the project (see examples below). 


## Examples:

*Commands like 'cat', 'ls', 'grep', 'wc', etc. can be used to test the project.<br>
*Single quotes and double quotes works the same as bash.<br>
Redirections ('<', '>', '<<', '>>') and pipes ('|') work as well.<br>
*Built-ins were also made from scratch (cd, echo, env, export, exit, pwd, unset).<br>
*Ctrl+C, Ctrl+D and Ctrl+\ are implemented the same way as bash.<br>
