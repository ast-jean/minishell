<p align="center">A Minimalist Shell</p>

Minishell is a lightweight, custom-built Unix shell implemented in C. It provides a minimalistic, user-friendly command-line interface, allowing users to execute common shell commands and navigate the file system. By implementing core shell functionalities from scratch, Minishell offers a unique opportunity to gain in-depth understanding of shell programming and Unix system calls. Perfect for educational purposes or as a foundation for more advanced shell projects, Minishell showcases the power of simplicity in a user-friendly package.


## Why:

Minishell is a school team-working project aiming to recreate our own bash.


## How To Use:

Use '$>`make`' then execute '$>`./minishell`' to start the program. You may use different commands to test the project (see examples below).  
`Readline needed` Install the Readline library "$>`brew install readline`"
Made for Unix based operating systems

## Examples:

- Commands like '`cat`', '`ls`', '`grep`', '`wc`', etc. can be used to test the project.<br>
- Single quotes and double quotes works the same as bash.<br>
- Redirections ('`<`', '`>`', '`>>`'), heredocs('`<<`'), herestrings('`<<<`') and pipes ('`|`') work as well.<br>
- Built-ins were also made from scratch (`cd`, `echo`, `env`, `export`, `exit`, `pwd`, `unset`).<br>
- `Ctrl+C`, `Ctrl+D` and `Ctrl+\` are implemented the same way as bash.<br>
